- Comments: Based this assignment's landing page off of GeeksForGeeks, I included two different divs that acted as navbars for different elements each with their own hover functionality. I used a shade a green and arial font to stylize the page. I also used some css action based selectors that make an audiofile appear based on the character that occupies the background image. There is also a dropdown menu that shows links to the inspiration website, and my github.

CSS selectors were difficult to work with when you approach it to making adjustments as you go along, because there are moments where you have to go back and refactor other selectors into ids and classes, and there's alot of disagreements between the selector statements as I proceeded to develop them. I also tried adding a video element, but sadly, the video wouldn't load.
